# Timestamp Blocks

The idea of this project is to provide and publish timestamps. You will be able
to install install it via pypi, but for now it's still in development. There
are global and local configuration files.  Once setup, a simple command will
index your current files via hashes and publish an overall hash, aka block, on
a channel of your choice, probably some blockchain or blockchain like
structure. It is recommended to use git or similar versioning tools to keep
track of the contents of your block.
