# Timestamp Blocks

The idea of this project is to provide and publish timestamps. You can and
should install it via pypi. There are global and local configuration files.
Once setup, a simple command will index your current files via hashes and
publish an overall hash, aka block, on a channel of your choice, probably some
blockchain or blockchain like structure. It is recommended to use git or
similar versioning tools to keep track of the contents of your block.
